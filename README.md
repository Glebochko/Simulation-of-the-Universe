- Clone project :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Glebochko/Simulation-of-the-Universe.git
```
- For convenience, it is better to make a virtual environment :
```bash
python3 -m venv graphics_UnvSim_venv
. graphics_UnvSim_venv/bin/activate
```
- Now download the graphics library :
```bash
pip3 install http://bit.ly/csc161graphics
```
Just in case I put the library file in the root of the project.
- Go to development branch for development :
```bash
cd Simulation-of-the-Universe
git checkout development
```
